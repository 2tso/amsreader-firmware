# Hardware options

There are currently two possible hardware options for this project, both in need of external power supply. A self powered board is under development by a member of the community and is currently being tested. 

## Hardware v1 by [@roarfred](https://github.com/roarfred)
Composed from a ESP12E (or F) chip, this ESP8266 based board is designed specifically for this project with an on board M-bus chip.

Building this project will require some skills in ordering and assembling electronic circuits as well as programming. No detailed instructions are available.
